# Markdown View Engine
**Disclaimer:** This is not a replacement of MVC Razor View Engine

### What is this?
This is just a prototype for building a new view engine for MVC in ASP.NET Core that uses Markdown `.md` instead of `cshtml`.

### Can I use it in Production?
Short answer **Not Yet**, the project is still prototype, and it's under development, all of you 're welcome to contribute to the source code.

### What are the plans for this project?
The project is still in the early stage, but I have some point to share:
- development
- Support layout pages aka master pages
- Ability to use some C# code within the markdown syntax
- Using some directive such as `@model` with different flavour
